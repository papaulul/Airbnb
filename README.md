# Airbnb Plus Listing Analysis

## Problem
Airbnb has implemented a new program called Airbnb Plus. Airbnb mark listings that they consider to be ["Beautiful homes. Exceptional hosts. Verified for quality."](airbnb.com/plus). These listings are verified in person before being approved to qualify. Also, as a host you would need to have a overall rating of 4.8 and haven't cancelled a reservation in the past year. They do have a [checklist](https://www.airbnb.com/b/plushomechecklist) avaliable on their website, however they seem to be more like guidelines rather than requirements.   

Why would owners want to go through the effort to achieve this rating? According to [Airbnb](airbnb.com/plus/host):

  *  plus badge
  * Elevated placement and better visibility in search results
  * All-new design and layout for listing page
  * Professional photography
  * 7 times more listing views
  * 70% more nights book 
## Solution
Using data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and personally scraped data, I will be looking into two cities, Los Angeles and San Fransico.
