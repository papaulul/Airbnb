# Airbnb Plus Listing Analysis

## Problem
Airbnb has implemented a new program called Airbnb Plus. Airbnb mark listings that they consider to be ["Beautiful homes. Exceptional hosts. Verified for quality."](airbnb.com/plus). These listings are verified in person before being approved to qualify. Also, as a host you would need to have a overall rating of 4.8 and haven't cancelled a reservation in the past year. They do have a [checklist](https://www.airbnb.com/b/plushomechecklist) avaliable on their website, however they seem to be more like guidelines rather than requirements.   

Why would owners want to go through the effort to achieve this rating? According to [Airbnb](airbnb.com/plus/host):
    * A plus badge 
    * Elevated placement and better visibility in search results
    * All-new design and layout for listing page
    * Professional photography 
    * 7 times more listing views 
    * 70% more nights book
